# Unistat
This plugin co-opts Indigo thermostat devices as general purpose threshold-response devices.  

Any numerical device state or variable value can be used as input (analogous to temperature), and devices can be switched on/off or action groups executed in response to the input value crossing a high threshold (analogous to cooling) and or low threshold (analogous to heating).

Example uses†:
* Thermostat
* Humidistat
* Lumistat
* Heliostat
* Anemostat
* Pluviostat
* Acoustistat
* Hydromistat
* Salinistat
